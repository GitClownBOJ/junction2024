HKOptimizer

In the EU, over 59 million tons of food waste are generated annually. HKFoods, one of Finland’s largest food producers, is tackling this with a smart system for real-time monitoring and analytics to reduce waste and improve efficiency, promoting sustainable and high-quality food production.
Project Goals
Real-Time Monitoring: Implement a system to continuously monitor batch weight and cooking data to detect any deviations that could affect product quality.
Data-Driven Quality Control: Leverage data analysis to ensure consistent quality across production batches and identify factors influencing weight loss during cooking.
Sustainability and Waste Reduction: Reduce food waste by minimizing weight loss variability and maintaining accurate batch weights, helping to prevent underweight and overweight products.
Expected Impact
By implementing this monitoring system, HKFoods will achieve:

Enhanced Quality Control: Real-time insights into batch consistency and quality across the production process.
Improved Production Efficiency: Reduction in rework and waste, aligning with HKFoods’ sustainability objectives.
Sustainable Production Practices: Decreased food waste through optimized processes and data-driven decisions.
